Hi Jan!

I failed to locate the original discussion (from v5.10-rt) as the V1 of this
patchset is a new thread. Anyway, you are correct, the commit below (and the
other two changes from the series) are not present in v5.10-rt.

AFAICT commit 49a17639508c ("softirq: Use a dedicated thread for timer wakeups
on PREEMPT_RT.") was merged initially to v6.13-rc1, it was never exclusive
to the RT tree.
